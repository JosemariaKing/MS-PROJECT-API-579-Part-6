# Fitness-For-Service API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, June, 2016
# PART 6 – ASSESSMENT OF PITTING CORROSION
#################################################################

# Pipe Data
# Material = SA 516
# Design Pressure = 300 psig
# Wall thickness = .75 in
# Uniform metal loss = 0.05 in
# Future Corrosion allowance = 0.07"
# Allowable Stress = 17500 psig
# Weld Joint Efficiency = 0.85
# Maximum Pitting Depth = .220

# Step 1
# Determine Do, FCA, Trd or Tnom and LOSS
# Do = outside diameter of the cylinder, corrected for LOSS and FCA, as applicable.
# FCA = Future Corrosion Allowance
# Trd = uniform thickness away from the damage area established by thickness measurements
# Tnom = nominal or furnished thickness of the component adjusted for mill undertolerance as applicable.
# LOSS = Amount of metal uniform loss

P = 300  # Design Pressure
#Do = 6.6259843  # Outside diameter
# Provide either Do (outside diameter) or D (inside diameter)
Do = None  # Outside diameter
D = 60  # Inside diameter (if provided, set to a value)

# Calculate D if Do is given
if D is None:
    D = Do - (2 * Tnom)
FCA = 0.07  # Future Corrosion Allowance
LOSS = 0.05  # No uniform loss as pitting
Tnom = 0.75  # Fabricated thickness
Trd = Tnom - LOSS  # Tnom - LOSS # Basically Trd is uniform loss adjacent to the pits (Pit Adjacent)

# Step 2 - Determine the wall thickness to be used in the assessment using Equation 6.1 or Equation 6.2 as applicable.
# tc = future corroded wall thickness away from the damage area
# tc = Trd - FCA
Tc = Trd - FCA  # .431 - 0.0299213

# Step 4 = Determine maximum pit depth, Wmax in and the minimum measured thickness for the pit with maximum depth, tmm
# Wmax = Maximum pit depth
# tmm = minimum measured wall thickness.
Wmax = 0.3 
tmm = Trd - Wmax

# Step 5 - Determine the ratio of the remaining wall thickness to the future wall thickness in the pitted region
# using Equation 6.3. In Equation (6.3), rd t can be replaced by nom t − LOSS . If 0.2 wt R < the Level 1
# assessment criteria are not met.
Rwt = tmm / Tc  # This is for pitting acting on one side only (assuming no internal corrosion)

# Check if passed the level 1 assessment
if Rwt >= 0.2:
    print(f"Yes, Rwt = {Rwt}")
else:
    print("Level 1 assessment has not been met")

# Step 6 - Determine the MAWP for the component (see Annex A, paragraph A.5) using the thickness from STEP 2.
Rc = (D / 2) + LOSS + FCA

# MAWP Per Annex 2c
# Circumferential MAWP ((2C.147))
Sa = 17500  # Allowable stress
E = 0.85  # Weld Joint Efficiency
MA = 0  # Mechanical allowances (thread or groove depth); for threaded components, the nominal thread
# depth (dimension h of ASME B.1.20.1) shall apply.
YB31 = 0.4  # Coefficient from ASME B31 Piping codes used for determining the pipe wall thickness, the
# coefficient can be determined from the following table that is valid for min 6 o t < D .
Tsl = 0  # Supplemental thickness for mechanical loads other than pressure that result in longitudinal stress;
# this thickness is usually obtained from the results of a weight case in a stress analysis of
# the piping system (see paragraph 2C.2.7).

# MAWPc = (2C.147)
MAWPc = ((Sa * E * Tc)/(Rc + (0.6 * Tc)))

# MAWPl = (2C.150)
MAWPl = ((Sa * E * (Tc - Tsl))/(Rc - (0.4 * (Tc - Tsl))))

# Find minimum of MAWPc and MAWPl
MAWP = min(MAWPc, MAWPl)
print(f"MAWP = {MAWP}")

# Step 7 # Compare the surface damage from the photographs or rubbings to the standard pit charts shown
# in Figures 6.3 through 6.10. Select a pit chart that has a measure of surface damage that approximates the
# actual damage on the component. If the pitting damage is more extensive than that shown in Figure 6.10,
# then compute the RSF using Equation 6.4 and proceed to STEP 9.
# Based on the picture, the closest Level 1 pitting chart is Figure E6.2-2
# Scale of the figure is 6 * 6 inches

# Basically: Use Rwt from STEP 5
print(f"Rwt = {Rwt}")

# We may interpolate on the table below the pit chart as per below
lower_rwt = 0.6
upper_rwt = 0.8
Rwt_Diff = upper_rwt - lower_rwt

# Now interpolate the Cylinder RSF value
lower_rsf = 0.95
upper_rsf = 0.97
RSF_Diff = upper_rsf - lower_rsf

print(f"Rwt_Diff = {Rwt_Diff}")
print(f"RSF_Diff = {RSF_Diff}")

# Solve for Interpolated RSF
RSF = lower_rsf + (RSF_Diff * ((Rwt - lower_rwt) / Rwt_Diff))

# Step 9
RSFa = 0.9
if RSF >= RSFa:
    MAWPr = MAWP
else:
    MAWPr = (RSF / RSFa) * MAWP
print(f"MAWPr = {MAWPr}")

if MAWPr < P:
    print("Pipe fails level 1 assessment")
else:
    print("Pipe passes level 1 assessment")
