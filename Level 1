# Level 1 
# Piping Assessment

#################################################################
# Fitness-For-Service API 579-1/ASME FFS-1, June, 2016
# PART 6 – ASSESSMENT OF PITTING CORROSION
#################################################################

# Pipe Data 
# Material = SA 106B
# Design Pressure = 250psig 
# Wall thickness = .431
# Uniform metal loss = 0
# Future Corrosion allownace = 0.03"
# Allowable Stress = 20,000psig
# Weld Joint Efficiency = 1
# Maximum Pitting Depth = .220 
P = 250

# Step 1 
# Determine Do, FCA, Trd or Tnom and LOSS
# Do = outside diameter of the cylinder, corrected for LOSS and FCA , as applicable.
# FCA = Future Corrosion Allowance 
# Trd = uniform thickness away from the damage area established by thickness measurements
# Tnom = nominal or furnished thickness of the component adjusted for mill undertolerance as applicable.
# LOSS = Amount of metal uniform loss 

Do = 6.6259843
FCA = 0.0299213
LOSS = 0  # No uniform loss as pitting 
Trd = 0.43188976 - 0 # Tnom - LOSS # Basically Trd is uniform loss adjacent to the pits ( Pit Adjacent)
Tnom = 0.43188976

# Step 2 - Determine the wall thickness to be used in the assessment using Equation 6.1 or Equation 6.2 as applicable.
# tc = future corroded wall thickness away from the damage area
# tc = Trd - FCA 
Tc = Trd - FCA # .431 - 0.0299213

# Step 3 - Locate the area on the component that has the highest density of pitting damage based on the 
# number of pits. Obtain photographs (include reference scale), or rubbings of this area to record the amount
# of surface damage. See Figure E6.2-1

# Step 4 = Determine maximum pit depth , Wmax in region of pitting damage 
# Wmax = Maximum pit
# tmm = minimum measured wall thickness.
Wmax = .220 
tmm = Trd - Wmax

# Step 5 - Determine the ratio of the remaining wall thickness to the future wall thickness in the pitted region
# using Equation 6.3. In Equation (6.3), rd t can be replaced by nom t − LOSS . If 0.2 wt R < the Level 1
# assessment criteria are not met.
Rwt = tmm/Tc # this is for pitting acting on 1x side only (assuming no internal corrosion) 

# Check if passed the level 1 assessment 
if (Rwt >= 0.2) { 
  cat("Yes", Rwt) 
 } else {
    print("Level 1 assessment has not been met")
 }

# Step 6 - Determine the MAWP for the component (see Annex A, paragraph A.5) using the thickness from STEP 2.
D = Do - (2*Tnom)
Rc = (D / 2) + LOSS + FCA

# MAWP Per Annex 2c
# Circumfrential MAWP ((2C.147))
Sa = 20000# Allowable stress
E = 1
MA = 0 # mechanical allowances (thread or groove depth); for threaded components, the nominal thread
# depth (dimension h of ASME B.1.20.1) shall apply.
YB31 = 0.4 #coefficient from ASME B31 Piping codes used for determining the pipe wall thickness, the
# coefficient can be determined from the following table that is valid for min 6 o t < D .
Tsl = 0 # supplemental thickness for mechanical loads other than pressure that result in longitudinal stress; 
#this thickness is usually obtained from the results of a weight case in a stress analysis of
#the piping system (see paragraph 2C.2.7).

# MAWPc = (2C.147)
MAWPc = (2 * (E * Sa) * (Tc - MA)) / (2*((YB31) * (Tc - MA))) - Do
2 * E * Sa * (Tc-MA) / (Do-((2*(YB31) * (Tc-MA))))

2 * 137.89 * 1 * (10.21-0) / (168.3-((2*(.4) * (10.21))))

137.89 * 145.038

Do

# MAWPl = (2C.150) 
MAWPl = 4 * E * Sa * (Tc-MA) / (Do-((4*(YB31) * (Tc-MA))))
4 * 137.89 * 1 * (10.21-0) / (168.3-((4*(.4) * (10.21))))

17500 * .85 * .63 / (30.12 + ((.6 * .63)))

# Note long is around 2* the circ. stress 

# Find minimum of MAWPc and MAWPl
MAWP = min(MAWPc,MAWPl)
MAWP

# Step 7 # Compare the surface damage from the photographs or rubbings to the standard pit charts shown
# in Figures 6.3 through 6.10. Select a pit chart that has a measure of surface damage that approximates the
# actual damage on the component. If the pitting damage is more extensive than that shown in Figure 6.10,
# then compute the RSF using Equation 6.4 and proceed to STEP 9.
# Based on the picture, the closest Level 1 pitting chart is Figure E6.2-2
# Scale of the figure is 6 * 6 inches 

# Basically: Use Rwt from STEP 5 
print(Rwt)
# = 0.5261845

# We may interpolate on the table below the pit chart as per below 
# First we have .526 from STEP 5
# The next Rwt number above and below 0.525 is: 
# 0.6 and 0.4 
lower_rwt = .4
Rwt_Diff = .6 - .4

# Now interpolate Cylinder RSF value 
lower_rsf = .85
RSF_Diff = .90 - .85

print(Rwt_Diff)
print(RSF_Diff)

# Solve for Interpolated RSF 
RSF = RSF_Diff * ((Rwt - lower_rwt) / Rwt_Diff) + lower_rsf

# Step 9
RSFa = .9
MAWPr = RSF / RSFa * MAWP

if (MAWPr < P) { 
  cat("Pipe fails level 1 assessment")
} else { 
    print("Pipe passes level 1 assessment")}
